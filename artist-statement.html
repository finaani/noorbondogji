            <h1>Hi, I'm Noor Bondogji,</h1>
            <p>I’m a Junior at San Jose State University pursuing a degree in Digital Media. When I came across the digital media application, I wanted to waste no time in applying. For me, this opportunity could not have come at a better time,
              because I am getting closer to my graduation, and I want to expand my skill set in a professional workforce. The hands-on work that I’ve done in projects and have learned in class made me realise that this is the major for me.
            </p>
            <p>My career goals in the future is to be a digital artist for a company to create digital advertising and marketing. In the long future, I aspire to make designs that would motivate our younger generations to find their passions.</P>

          <div class="clearfix"></div>

          <hr>
          <p>In order to achieve that goal, I have gained side experience in digital media art from working in freelancing and charity projects that involved the development of websites, and launching marketing campaigns for the benefit of schools
            and charity organizations. This motivated me to go further and practice my skills I have learned/is learning at SJSU. I did an internship for a program where I had the privilege of teaching kids python through Apple’s Swift Language. I
            created designs for flyers, managed marketing online and in person. Not only did this help me explore my dream in working, but I was also able to help teach others and give back to my community. Digital media is not just about making art
            but it is a way that can be educational and fun for our communities.</p>
          <p>I strongly believe that perseverance is one of the main essential skills of a digital artist. I always wanted to be an artist growing up but never knew specifically what I wanted to do. During my high school and college years I explored
            my options and took many courses ranging from life drawing, to video editing. I started working with freelance photography; I took courses about photography and learned photoshop. </p>
          <p>I really enjoyed working with art and mostly digital. I took it further, weekends I would work on tutorials at home, such as graphic design and animation. Animation stuck with me the most because it would get me frustrated when learning
            to work with it, but I never gave up and when I finished my first project I realised that it felt good to be challenged by it. Due to that experience, I explored digital art more and discovered digital media was the major I want to be in
            and I did my research for it and applied to San Jose State. </p>
